The Social Showdown Game


### **Welcome to the Follower Frenzy Game! This is a simple game where you have to guess which of two social media accounts has more followers. The game will present you with two accounts, and your task is to decide which one has more followers.**

## **Gameplay**

1. You'll be presented with two accounts for comparison.
2. Choose 'A' or 'B' to guess which account has more followers.
3. Your score will be displayed, and the game will continue until you make a wrong guess.

## **Customizing Data**

You can customize the data used in the game by modifying the `data` list in the `game_data.py` file. Each data entry contains information about a social media account, including its name, follower count, description, and country.
